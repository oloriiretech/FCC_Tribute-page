            <header><strong>The Biography Of Steve Jobs</strong></header>
            <p> Steve Jobs was born on February 24, 1955, in San Francisco to Joanne Schieble (later Joanne Simpson) and
                Abdulfattah “John” Jandali, two University of Wisconsin graduate students.
                The couple gave up their unnamed son for adoption. As an infant, Jobs was adopted by Clara and Paul Jobs
                and named Steven Paul Jobs.
                Clara worked as an accountant, and Paul was a Coast Guard veteran and machinist. Jobs’ biological
                father, Jandali, was a Syrian political science professor.
                His biological mother, Schieble, worked as a speech therapist. Shortly after Jobs was placed for
                adoption, his biological parents married and had another child, Mona Simpson.

            <header><strong>Brife Facts About Steve Jobs</strong></header>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Jobs lived with his adoptive family in Mountain View, California, within the area that would later
                    become known as Silicon Valley.
                    He was curious from childhood, sometimes to his detriment. According to the BBC’s Science Focus
                    magazine, Jobs was taken to the
                    emergency room twice as a toddler—once after sticking a pin into an electrical socket and burning
                    his hand, and another time because
                    he had ingested poison. His mother Clara had taught him to read by the time he started kindergarten.
                </li>
                <li>Jobs and his father worked on electronics in the family garage. Paul showed his son how to take
                    apart and reconstruct electronics, a hobby that instilled confidence,
                    tenacity, and mechanical prowess in young Jobs. Although Jobs was always an intelligent and
                    innovative thinker, his youth was riddled with frustrations over formal schooling.
                    Jobs was a prankster in elementary school due to boredom, and his fourth-grade teacher needed to
                    bribe him to study.</li>
                <li>While attending Homestead High School, Jobs joined the Explorer’s Club at Hewlett-Packard. It was
                    there that he saw a computer for the first time.
                    He even picked up a summer job with HP after calling company cofounder Bill Hewlett to ask for parts
                    for a frequency counter he was building.
                    It was at HP that a teenaged Jobs met he met his future partner and cofounder of Apple Computer
                    Steve Wozniak, who was attending the University of California, Berkeley.
                    After high school, Jobs enrolled at Reed College in Portland, Oregon. Lacking direction, he withdrew
                    from college after six months and spent the next year and a half dropping
                    in on creative classes at the school. Jobs later recounted how one course in calligraphy developed
                    his love of typography.</li>
                <li>Steve Jobs was an American inventor, designer, and entrepreneur who was the cofounder, chief
                    executive, and
                    chairman of Apple Inc.
                    Born in 1955 to two University of Wisconsin graduate students who gave him up for adoption, Jobs was
                    smart
                    but directionless, dropping out of college and experimenting with different pursuits before
                    cofounding
                    Apple with Steve Wozniak in 1976. Jobs left the company in 1985, launching Pixar Animation Studios,
                    then
                    returned to Apple more than a decade later.
                    The tech giant’s revolutionary products, which include the iPhone, iPad, and iPod, have dictated the
                    evolution of modern technology.
                    Jobs died in 2011 following a long battle with pancreatic cancer.</li>
